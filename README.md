# Measuring time performance in `C++`

A simple C++ implementation of a time measurement tool, using `std::chrono`  

The code implementation is based on a YT video which can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG4jexlSAjc&t=610s).

Integration with CircleCI is also done just for a simple workflow.
Project is build with CMake.
